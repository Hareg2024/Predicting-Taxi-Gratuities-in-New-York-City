# Predicting-Taxi-Gratuities-in-New-York-City
Overview 

* The purpose of this project was to develop a multiple linear regression and random forest model that predicts whether or not a rider would receive a high gratuity. This project used yellow taxi trips taken in New York City in 2017. The optimized random forest model performed with 86% accuracy and 72% precision when evaluating which variables were most relevant in distinguishing between low and high tippers. The model found that the time, distance, and fare amount had the greatest impact on whether a tipper was generous (>20%) or not (<20%).

## Business Understanding 
According to salary.com the average salary for a New York Taxi Driver is around $45,000. This salary is significantly low compared to a median rent value of $6,500 per month. It is important to understand what factors encourage riders to leave tips in order to help drivers obtain a livable wage. 

## Data Understanding
The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission data came from 
NYC.gov. The data consisted of approximately 408k unique trips and 18 features. The features included information on trip duration and destination, vendor used, toll information, and payment type. The bar chart below shows the breakdown of how many generous tippers (>20%) versus non-generous tippers that exist in the data set.

In connection to this, a feature was engineered to represent if a ride was taken during rush hour or not. Multiple redundant columns were dropped and reformatted into the proper data type.

## Modeling and Evaluation 
A random forest model comprising 100 decision trees was used to determine feature importance in who would tip generously or not. The below plot shows that trip duration, distance, and the cost of a fare were the Top 3 most important factors in determining a generous tipper from a non-generous one. The overall model performed with 86% accuracy and 72% precision.

## Conclusion
This model can benefit Taxi Drivers in knowing if they will be tipped generously or not; however, running a parametric model to determine how much each variable will influence the actual price of the tip. In the future, adding more information on a riderâ€™s past tipping behavior may also be beneficial in helping the stakeholder address their business problem.
